+ work 1: swap task files
+ work 2: model1-model2 linear
    + split `val dataset`(already exist train data and test data)
    + add `vgg16` net to test `(x)`
    + `dfcn`
    + `dcnn` modify
    + **why does the accuracy always be zero?** (do not know the reason)
+ work 3: file modify 
    + added pretrained `vgg16-fc6`, is it a same result? 
        + Unfortunately, it is same result. fuck.
